Have you ever thought about how your hiring process affects your company in form
of stock price? And how does your public employee satisfaction rate like on the Glasshouse
website affect your company?

I am Marco and my project is answering those and more questions by analyzing various sources of data like: 
- A huge Linkedin data set
- Google trends
- Glasshouse employee satisfaction rates
- and the stock market price.

In order to build a model for effective prediction of how your actions on for example Linkedin can
affect your company, I propose first only looking at data that directly concerns your company and later in the project to
build a hierarchical model to also include information from other companies in your industry.
