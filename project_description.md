This project is about analyzing data from job postings on Linkedin (data from Thinkium) combined with various other sources of data. In my draft I focus on a specific company, but the full project should give a way to automate this for any company. I focus on the company "Activision". Further data sources are: Google Trends for "Activision", stocks data from Yahoo finance and survey data from Glassdoor.

The idea is to find correlations between the data and a way to predict one (or all) from the combined past of all of them. For example one could ask if employee satisfaction can predict job openings or if employee satisfaction and job openings together can predict the stock price on a medium time scale. The goal is not to predict stock price on a short time scale. Also it might be of great interest for a company how job openings on Linkedin can influence their stock price. Is it better to post the job opening now or tomorrow? When in the next week would be the ideal time?

The project plan is the following:
- For one company (Activision) collect as much data as possible and combine it into one file. From the Linkedin data I one can get the following features of the time series: number of employees, followers, open positions (in a specific time frame), the google trend, stock price, difference between high and low of the stock (day), trade volume (day), employees in the same industry as the company, followers of companies in the same industry, job openings in the same industry, employee satisfaction (Glassdoor). Note: I have not yet been able to download the Glassdoor data, so it is not in the notebook yet.
- Use different time series prediction methods to predict the general trend. First try simple ones like Facebook Prophet, and simple Neural Networks. Then try different standard multivariate time series prediction methods. Also a flag for product releases or shitstorms would be a good feature for those models. The ultimate goal would be a hierarchical Bayesian model.
- Generalize and automate this workflow for other companies.
- Use data from all companies to build a hierarchical model. Basically the idea is that also in the data of the other companies there is information that can help predicting our chosen company.
